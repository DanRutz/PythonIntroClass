About me:
  First computer:
     -- Commodore Pet -- 8k RAM
     -- Basic
  High School:
     -- PDP 11 -- paper printer terminal 200baud modem 
     -- Basic
  College: 
     -- Pascal:  VAX/VMS  750 
     -- Scheme:  Unix VAX 780
  Then a long Break: Theater Arts Major, Scenery, Lighting...

  Back to School: PhD Engineering
     DOS / Windows 3.1
       -- FORTRAN
       -- MATLAB
     Discovered Linux (RedHat 2.0)

  Now:
    Oceanographer for NOAA:
       Oil Spill Modeling, Software Development
    
    Gave TCL a try..
    
    Gave Perl a try..
    
    Discovered Python in 1998
      - It could do what Perl could do,
          - what TCL could do,
          - what MATLAB could do,
          - But I liked it -- it fit my brain
      - My primary language since then

    My Python use now:
      - Lots of text file crunching
      - Lots of data processing scripts 
      - Automation of downloading, processing data
      - Desktop GUIs (wxPython)
      - computational code
      - wrapping C/C++ code      
      - web apps (Pylons, Pyramid)
      - GIS processing
      - Ask me about "BILS" 
      
      
Key Words:

and       del       from      not       while    
as        elif      global    or        with     
assert    else      if        pass      yield    
break     except    import    print              
class     exec      in        raise              
continue  finally   is        return             
def       for       lambda    try:

Built-ins: dir(__builtins__)
