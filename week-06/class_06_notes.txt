Notes for week 5 class:


mix-ins

polymorphism

classes are for code re-use, not for defining taxonomies

if you have a class with two methods, and one of them is __init__ -- you don't need a class.

class attributes -- sharing a value...

how do you spelling "switch/case" with classes

foreach (var animal in zoo) {
    switch (typeof(animal)) {
        case "dog":
            echo animal.bark();
            break;

        case "cat":
            echo animal.meow();
            break;
    }
}

becomes

foreach (var animal in zoo) {
    echo animal.speak();
}
