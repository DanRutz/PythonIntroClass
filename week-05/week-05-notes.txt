Sockets:

"it's the bind() that makes it a server"

"it's the connect that makes it a client"

who sends and receives is application dependent.

one half of the connection has to have some a-priory knowledge.


telnet briandorsey.info 80

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host briandorsey.info

telnet briandorsey.info 80

GET / HTTP/1.1         
Host: yumikodorsey.com

use client to make a micro web browser - one site, dump the html to the console.

Steps:

echo server -- echo client

echo server: point the browser at it

edit echo server to return something else -- some hhtp

have it add the right headers for http.
